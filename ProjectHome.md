Approximate and vectorized versions of functions commonly used in machine learning.

The easiest way to get it is via the [one big standalone header file](http://fastapprox.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fastapprox/src/fastonebigheader.h) which works with both C and C++.

Current functions:

  * exponential, logarithm, and power
  * lgamma and digamma
  * cosh, sinh, tanh
  * cos, sin, tan
  * sigmoid and erf
  * Lambert W

There's a [Mathematica notebook](http://fastapprox.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fastapprox/tests/fastapprox.nb) which helps explain the techniques.
